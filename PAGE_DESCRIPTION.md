Mean Mobs makes farm animals act more like real animals in Minecraft.

If you get too close to sheep, pigs, cows, or chickens, they will actually run away from you instead of just staring. Movement is key—they don't like players invading their space.

Watch out though—if you punch a sheep, pig, or cow, they won't just take it anymore. They will fight back and bite you! Chickens are the exception; they’ll just panic and run even faster.

The mod also adds smarter weather awareness. When it starts raining, these animals will look for dry spots and take shelter under trees or overhangs to stay out of the storm.

Works on both Fabric and NeoForge for Minecraft 1.21.1 through 1.21.11.
